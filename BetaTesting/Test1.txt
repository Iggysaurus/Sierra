Bug and the thing that i think it's wrong.
1). Tar Bat animation is very weird.
2). Volcanic chest is look weird.
3). Enchanted Bow is too small.
4). Runic Bow shooted his own projectiles same time as arrow that player used (even Wooden Arrow)
5). True Runic Bow shooted only 1 colour projectile and another arrow was the arrow that player used (except Wooden Arrow)



Question that I want to ask
1). Slime Launcher didn't requested any ammo?
2). Magmatic Hook suppose to be a speedy hook?
3). Volcanic enemies drop nothing?
4). Tar eneimes also spawn in Corrupt and crimson desert?



The thing that I want to suggest
1). Molten chunk shuld give player a fire buff when player step on it.
2). Projectile or dust for Enchanted tools.
3). Nerfed Magma Rapier.
4). In my opinion, Tar Slicer should be "usestyle = 5" 
5). Lizard Tail can be vanity as well by add a tail to player.
6). Nerfed all currently monsters a bit tbh. 
7). Add a grow light to Void Monolith.
8). Magma Bat too speedy.
